# This Project uses the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark and Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Datasets, to train yolov8 nano models.
## The detection model(gtsdb.pt) detects the traffic signs in the current frame and passes the cropped traffic sign to recognition model(gtsrb.pt) for Recognition
